This is a mod for Cataclysm:Bright Night. 

It adds some martial arts, which were designed after the movements of beasts.

You can find manuals of these martial arts from statues, and among these statues are mimics that imitate them. 

You can reveal them by using relic mirrors, which can be found in the pawnstore, museum, antique shop... or by **making one of them with its recipe** from a specific book. Don't worry. The book is in Cataclysm:Bright Night already and not very rare.


There are 6 kinds of MA. Each MA has practical bonuses for melee combat and is best used with specific weapons. For instance, the Goat style is best used with weapons in the SPEARS or PIKES category, while the Boar style can be used with many bludgeoning weapons such as CLUBS.

Whichever you choose, these styles won't disappoint you!
